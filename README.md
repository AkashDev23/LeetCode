This repository serves as a personal archive of algorithmic problem solutions that I've encountered and solved on LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. Solutions are organized by platform and problem number for easy reference.


Currently, solutions are primarily implemented in Java.

Each solution file is named descriptively to indicate the problem source, problem number, and programming language used (e.g., `leetcode_001_two_sum.py`).

## LeetCode



LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. Problems are categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and cover a wide range of algorithmic concepts and data structures.



## GeeksforGeeks



GeeksforGeeks is a website that offers learning resources and practice problems in computer science subjects, including algorithms and data structures.
